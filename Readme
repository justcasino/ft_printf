The objective of this assignment is to recreate my own printf function.

A format specifier follows this prototype :
%[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier

These are format conversion specifiers that have to be accounted for
 s = string.
 S =
 p = pointer address.
 d = signed decimal integer.
 D
 i = signed decimal integer
 o = unsigned octal.
 O
 u = unsigned decimal integer.
 U
 x = unsigned hexadecimal integer
 X = unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)
 c = character
 C




For Bonus
eE = scientific notation (mantissa/ exponent), lowercase ex: 3.9265e+2
fF = decimal floating point ex: 392.65
gG = use th shortest representation: %e or %f ex: 392.65
aA = hexadecimal floating point ex: -0xc.90fep-2
n = Nothing printed.  The corresponding argument must be a pointer to a signed
    int.
    the number of characters written so far is stored in the pointed location.

Manage
 %% = A % followed by another % character will write a single % to the stream.


//Flags\\
# = used with o, x, or X specifiers the value is preceeded with 0, 0x or 0X
    respectively for values different than zero.

0 = Left- pads the number with zeroes (0) instead of spaces when width is
    specified

- = Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the
    default

+ = Forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for
    positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with
    a - sign.

 (space) = If no sign is going to be write, a blank space is inserted before
          the value.

//length\\
hh - z (see specifiers below)
h
l
ll
j
z

//Bonus Flags\\
*

L
'

//Width\\
(number) = Minimum number of characters to be printed.  If the value to be
           printed is shorter than this number,the result is padded with
           blanks spaces.  The value is not truncated even if the result is
           larger.

*        = The width is not specified in the format string, but as an additional
           integer value argument preceding the argument that has to be
           formatted.  (not used with strings)

//.precision\\
.number = For integer specifiers (d, i, o, u, x, X): precision specifies the
          minimum number of digits to be written.  If the value to be written is
          shorter than this number, the result is padded with leading zeros.
          The value is not truncated even if the result is longer. A precision
          of 0 means that no character is written for the value 0.
          For a, A, e, E, f and F specifiers: this is the number of digits to be
          printed after the decimal point (by default, this is 6).
          For g and G specifiers: This is the maximum number of significant
          digits to be printed.
          For s: this is the maximum number of characters to be printed. By
          default all characters are printed until the ending null character
          is encountered.
          If the period is specified without an explicit value for precision,
          0 is assumed.

.*      = The precision is not specified in the format string, but as an
          additional integer value argument preceding the argument that has to
          be formatted.
